## Summer Project 2017

This was a game I created to practice my skills with C/C++ and the SDL graphics library. This was helpful in understanding the C++ language as well as SDL which helped with the development of the ZEUS System.

I ran out of time trying to finish the game as the entire year has been hectic. The game was meant to involve a shop system where a user can use the "scrap" they gain from in game to improve ships and buy new ones. It was decided that until I have proper time to finish the game the shop is pre-programmed with 500,000 scrap so feel free to test the different ships.

Most of the game mechanics are finished, it is only the shop and progression system that requires attention.
